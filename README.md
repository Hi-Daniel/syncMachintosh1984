# Arduino Project:

## syncMachintosh1984

I couldn't think of a better name...
Using an ESP32 and a 2.4" TFT LCD-touchscreen
(ILI9341) I will be creating a mini paint application that is synced
with a second ESP32 at all times.

The name syncMachintosh1984 refers to the fact that the final product
will look like a mini machintosh from 1984.
